# K-Means-Clustering-using-C++
Rewrite a function to implement the K-Means Clustering in C++.
<br>

* `input` is a `vector` container which stored the coordinates `Point2f` as (x, y), and `K` can be the user defined parameters which idicates the number of clusters in this algorithm<br><br>
* `output` are the same c++ type of `vector<Point2f>` to store the clustered centroiods.<br>
